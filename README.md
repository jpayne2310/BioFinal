# BioFinal
For this final "bio" assignment you will utilize a "floating" structure to your pages.

Tip: I would start with "blank" clean HTML and CSS files. Float the main skeletal elements then start bringing in existing graphics from your prior homework.

Directions:

Main container or "wrapper" div must center in the browser.

Use a floating structure for: 

Header
Nav
Content Div ( if you have a content div and a sidebar you would float one left and the other right)
Clear the footer so it stays at the bottom of the content.

Use where appropriate, "semantic" elements such as:

Heading tags
Nav Tags
Section tags
Article Tags
Aside Tags
The Footer Tag
Style all 3 pages using one CSS document.
